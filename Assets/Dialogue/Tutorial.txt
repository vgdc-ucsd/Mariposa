#INT. UNDERGROUND SHOPS - DAY


#[IN-GAME] MARIPOSA stands outside the underground shops. BEEBO floats beside her.  


!name start


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
(Looks like I’ve got a bit of time before the job.)


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
(I can’t wait to get home and take a nice, long nap...)


MARIPOSA
(happy)
Let’s get going, BEEBO!


#[GAMEPLAY]- INTRODUCTION TO MARIPOSA MECHANICS. 


#At the station, MARIPOSA sees a guard standing in front of a taped-off turnstile. Talk to the GUARD. 
!name guard


MARIPOSA
(happy)
Hey there! You called for a faulty turnstile? 


GUARD
Oh, yeah. Guess we did. It’s been acting up. Sometimes works, sometimes doesn’t. Don’t really know what’s wrong with it.


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
Got it! No worries, I’ll get this thing working in no time.


GUARD
Good to hear. Here’s the card for the thing. Or whatever. I’ll just, I don’t know, wait here until you’re done.


#MARIPOSA gets to work, examining the turnstile. She puts the card into the machine to open it, but the machine ejects it out of the other end.
!name turnstyle_keycard
MARIPOSA
(Surprised)
Oh! Well. 


MARIPOSA
(Neutral)
BEEBO, can you grab the keycard for me? 


MARIPOSA
#removed bashful since there is no bashful sprite
#(bashful)
Looks like this turnstile is giving me more trouble than I had anticipated...


BEEBO
<Putting task: Get Keycard into task list. Task number 17. Would you like to prioritize this task?>


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
Please do. Thanks, BEEBO!

There we go. Everything should be in order now!

Oh, you’re finished? Thanks. Someone’ll send the payment later.

See you around!

Sure. See ya.

#The GUARD walks away, and MARIPOSA heads to the platform through the recently fixed turnstile. PLAYER will have the option of interacting with NPCs in the tunnel, but once she progresses far enough, the game will stop her. She will remain idle and wait for the train.

MARIPOSA

BEEBO, how much time until the train gets here?


BEEBO
<ETA: 12 Minutes>


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
Hmm, I think I have some time then. Can you pull up my notes for Project #314? Let’s see if I can’t get this thing working...


A static crackling noise echoes in the subway tunnel.


UNNAMED 
#(blank portrait)
---not much left around here. Might have to head back soon.


MARIPOSA 
(surprised)
Hello? Is someone there?

#[GAMEPLAY]- INTRODUCTION TO UNNAMED MECHANICS


#UNNAMED walks into the gutted train car. They eventually pick up the RADIO. 
!name radio_pickup


UNNAMED 
#(muttering)
The hell is this? 


#Show radio.
!event show_radio


UNNAMED 
(neutral)
Just scrap metal. Might have some useful parts though.


UNNAMED
(neutral)
...Not much left around here.


#A static crackling noise echoes in the subway tunnel. An unknown voice flickers in and out of audibility. The screen may shake slightly as the sound of gnashing metal rumbles through the tunnel. 
!event screenshake
!audio tunnel


MARIPOSA 
#(startled)
Hello? Is someone there?


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
Can you hear me?


MARIPOSA
...
Thought I already rewired this part...


UNNAMED
(surprised)
(How do I shut this thing off??)


#UNNAMED escapes from the train car. They move to the maintenance room and try the emergency exit. It’s jammed.

!name door_jammed
UNNAMED
(neutral)
Of course the door is jammed. Why wouldn’t it be?


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
What’s happening? It’s awfully noisy on your end, stranger.


UNNAMED
#(ignoring her)
Can’t backtrack. And I won’t be able to hold off those bots forever. 


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
A bot? Is it malfunctioning? 


MARIPOSA
(happy)
I could help you out if you tell me what’s wrong! Could you describe—--


UNNAMED
Damn it, how do I get out of here?


MARIPOSA
(sad)
Um—--alright then.




#>NEW AREA (DUO-GAMEPLAY TUTORIAL)


#UNNAMED explores the maintenance room with the JAMMED DOOR. They can make comments on various useless items they find. Eventually, they find a BATTERY in this area. 
!name battery


UNNAMED
(neutral)
A battery with nothing to put it in. If only there were any of those maintenance bots still around...
...
Which don’t want to kill me, that is. 


UNNAMED
(neutral)
...but they scrapped the chargers for parts a long, long time ago. 


#PLAYER now switches to MARIPOSA.
!event switch_mariposa1


MARIPOSA
(I think I’ll give them a bit of space for now. Seems like they’re not interested in talking to me...)


#She notices the train still hasn’t arrived and decides to walk around. She can walk around the platform. She will see the charging station for maintenance bots.


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
But that reminds me...speaking of maintenance bots...


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
There’s a charger for them right here. Though, honestly, it looks kind of scuffed... 


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
Needs just a few little tweaks to get back into shape, though. I wonder why no one’s bothered?


MARIPOSA
(happy)
Well, since I’m here...I’ll keep the bots running around here in good shape for a bit longer.


#[BEE] hits the lever to restart the electricity flow to the charger on the edge of the platform. MARIPOSA completes a block puzzle to fully fix the charging station, and the maintenance robot will be able to function again.

MARIPOSA
There we go! Everything’s in working order now.


BEEBO
<ALERT: Train has been delayed. Estimated wait time: 1 hour. Recommended Route: Bus.>


MARIPOSA
#(exasperated)
Delayed? Again? That’s the second time this week...


BEEBO
<Understood. Do you wish to file a complaint?>


MARIPOSA
No! No, I mean---Don’t send anything, BEEBO. Let’s just head to the bus stop. I don’t want to get back to town too late.


!event switch_unnamed2
#PLAYER now switches to UNNAMED.


#UNNAMED is still stuck in the room. 
!name unnamed_stuck


MARIPOSA
So...How are things going for you there? Fixed your bot situation?


UNNAMED
(neutral)
...


MARIPOSA
Well, I fixed things on my end. I know a few things about bots if you need some help; If you just describe what you’re seeing...I could tell you what to do?


NARRATION 
[You hear a faint clicking sound. The soft hum of electricity fills the room.]


UNNAMED
(Maybe I missed something.)


#UNNAMED looks around the room again. If he clicks on anything that hasn’t changed, he repeats prior dialogue. In the room, there is now a deactivated maintenance bot. 


#UNNAMED can interact with this bot to progress.


!name unnamed_bot
UNNAMED
(neutral)
(Was this always here? I thought I checked this whole room.)


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
What is it? You found something?


UNNAMED
...


UNNAMED
#(hesitant)
You said you...fixed something. What did you do?


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
You...were listening? It was a charger for the maintenance bots at this station. It needed a bit of tuning up, but it should be good for a little while.


UNNAMED
(neutral)
What model?


MARIPOSA
(neutral)
Hmm. Not sure, actually. I think my station is still on the MK6? They’re pretty reliable, if a little clunky. 


MARIPOSA
(happy)
I think they’re cute, though! 


UNNAMED
(neutral)
(That’s...not possible...)


UNNAMED 
(neutral)
(But I wonder if the battery would still...)


#UNNAMED puts the battery into the bot. It powers on.


NARRATION
<i>You slot the battery into the automaton. The charging station starts to churr. The automaton creaks to life. It barely moves, but its eyes begin to glow.</i>


AUTOMATON
DOOR...7...8...6...4...2...EMERGENCY...OVERRIDE.

NARRATION
<i>It's struggling to move. The charging station sounds like it's straining to keep it alive.</i>

#PLAYER puts in code. The lock sparks, and the door is now unlocked. UNNAMED exits immediately after.
