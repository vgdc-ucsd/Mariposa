- Put the button prefab into a canvas
- in the button properties component put in the values
    - fileName sets the file that will be checked to change the color of the button depending on if the file exists
    - enabled color is the color for if the file exists
    - disabled color is the color if the file doesn't exist
        - make sure the alpha in the color picker isnt 0 so you dont get confused for 15 minutes about why the background doesn't work
- in the OnClick() section of the button below drag the dataPersistenceManager game object into the bttom left box
- then get it to use the function you want to use like LoadGame/DeleteGame
- use the same filename you used before in the text box below
- it should work!!!!!
